The Oracles
===========

We propose two classes for the computation of the first order oracle associated to our DC formulation. Both oracles take as an input an instance of Problem and a few paramters such as the safety probability threshold.

The classes differ in that the second one support numba-compliant problem classes. Given the ``numba`` option provided when instantiating an Optimizer, first or second class will be instantiated for solving.
