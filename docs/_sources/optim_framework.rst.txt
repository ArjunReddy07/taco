The Optimization Framework
==========================

Taco provides a class ``Optimizer`` aimed at handling the whole optimization process described in our paper.
This class takes as an input the problem instance provided by the user and the parameters the algorithm need to be launched.
The method ``run`` of this class runs the optimization process and retrieves the solution found.
